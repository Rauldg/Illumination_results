In this case an incremental experiment was performed.

- Samples execute one mission at a time. The missions are increasingly complex.

- The results from the experiment 8 are reused: Make new mutations until all the missions are achieved.

- Perform 5 replications of each sample.

The goal performance is lowered to 0.57
